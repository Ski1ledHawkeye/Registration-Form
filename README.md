# Registration-Form

This is a simple GUI based form project which collects the user data and stores it in your system in a .txt file. 
To compile and run this project first all you need to create a java class named "form" in any IDE and secondly you need to change the file location according to your compatibility
or else it will give run time error. 
This code might have some bugs in it.
